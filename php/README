Additional installation steps.

[1] Install Ext JS 3.3.x open source (required)

Download ExtJS from http://www.sencha.com/products/js/download.php
or from http://www.vitki.net/sites/vitki.net/files/attachments/ext-3.3.1.zip
then unzip ext-3.3.x/ under directory ./html/js
and create symbolic link from "ext-3.3.x" to "ext".
For example:
 cd ./html/js
 wget http://www.vitki.net/sites/vitki.net/files/attachments/ext-3.3.1.zip
 unzip -q ext-3.3.1.zip
 ln -s ext-3.3.1 ext

[2] Install LovCombo (required)

Download LovCombo from http://lovcombo.extjs.eu/ into directory ./html/js
For example:
 cd ./html/js
 mkdir lovcombo
 cd lovcombo
 wget http://www.vitki.net/sites/vitki.net/files/attachments/lovcombo.tar.gz
 tar xzf lovcombo.tar.gz
 ln -s ../ext .

[3] Setup alternative theme (optional)

You can use an alternative WebUI theme under ./html/css.
See available themes at http://extjs.fudini.net/.
Example of installation:
 cd ./html/css
 wget http://extjs.fudini.net/themes/ext_theme_12.zip
 unzip -q ext_theme_12.zip
 mv 12 theme-12
 wget http://extjs.fudini.net/themes/ext_theme_22_grey.zip
 unzip -q ext_theme_21_grey.zip
 mv 21 theme-21

After installing new theme edit ./config/wacman.ini
and modify the "theme_css" parameter, e.g.:
 theme_css = css/theme-12/resources/css/ext-all.css

[4] Secure your configuration files (required)

Your configuration files contain such sensitive information as passwords.
To avoid inappropriate access set file permissions as follows:
 chown root:apache ./config/* ./bin/*
 chmod 640 ./config/*
 chmod 750 ./bin/*

[5] Configure root access rights for helper scripts (optional)

If you plan to use such features as automatic creation or removal
of user home directories, you should allow sudo'ing of helper scripts.
Run the "visudo" command and add the following lines:
 Defaults:apache !requiretty
 apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:      /path/to/wacman/bin/suhelper.sh *

Note: Normally PHP is run by web server as user "apache".
      If your case differs, use approriate user name in snippets above.
